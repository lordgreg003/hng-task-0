                Hi dear, my name is Nwokoye Chidera. I develop efficient and
                scalable web solutions. I tell computers "DO THIS!!", and they
                refuse. Then I cry for a very long time ðŸ˜­
              </p>
              <p data-testid="shortBio">
                Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer with a strong passion for
                front-end development. I love creating beautiful, responsive
                user interfaces that provide a seamless experience for users. My
                journey into web development began with front-end technologies,
                and over time, I expanded my skills to back-end development,
                which has allowed me to build more complete and dynamic web
                applications. As I continue to grow as a developer, I am
                constantly learning new technologies and striving to improve my
                skills in both front-end and back-end development, as well as
                mobile app development.

                scalable, user-centered web applications, I strive to enhance my
                skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies to

              <p class="goal-description">
                As a full-stack developer with a deep passion for front-end
                technologies, my goal is to continue expanding my skills in both
                the front-end and back-end areas. I aim to build more complex,
                scalable applications while maintaining a focus on creating
                intuitive, user-friendly interfaces. Additionally, with the rise
                of mobile usage, I plan to explore mobile app development using
                frameworks like React Native and Flutter to create
                cross-platform applications that deliver seamless experiences
                across devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also recognize the importance of understanding how front-end
                and back-end work together to build efficient applications.
                Therefore, I am committed to gaining expertise in back-end
                technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and databases, enabling
                me to create full-stack solutions. As I progress in my career, I
                intend to stay updated on emerging trends and tools in web and
                mobile development to ensure that I remain at the forefront of
                the ever-evolving tech industry.
